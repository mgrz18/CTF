## Objetivo
Can you figure out what is in the eax register at the end of the main function? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: picoCTF{n} where n is the contents of the eax register in the decimal number base. If the answer was 0x11 your flag would be picoCTF{17}. Disassemble [this](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/512/debugger0_a).

## Pistas
- gdb is a very good debugger to use for this problem and many others!
- main is actually a recognized symbol that can be used with gdb commands.

## Soluci√≥n
